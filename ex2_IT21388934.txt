**Question 2**
1.What happens when the number of hidden nodes increase?

Accuracy Changes

2.Can you explain the pattern of the accuracy when the hidden nodes increase?

Accuracy increased till the 3 hidden layers, But the when number of hidden layers are 4 accuracy dropped. Again when the number of hidden layers are 5 accuracy increased up to 91.25% , it is the highest accuracy from the tested number of hidden layers. When increasing the number of hidden layers the accuracy dropped again.

That means all the time that number of hidden layers are increase , the accuracy does not increase . It might be dropped as well.
